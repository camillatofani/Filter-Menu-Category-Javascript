### Technical information
<a name="technical"></a>

This project it's the hardest from when I start this challenge. I start to learn what does it means the function declaration anche the argument declaration.
I created an array with the menu information and I loop that with a function.
I created a function only for the button of category. With '.push' and '(!values.includes(item.category))' I find the type of category present in the array and then I print in to the HTML.
